####Script Intentions

This plugin's current purpose is to allow the user to click on any given object in SketchUp (point, line, face) and the script will automatically create a Spot Elevation Marker that references the z-height of the object at the selected point, and will update based on changes made to the terrain (likely a manual refresh to prevent lagging/crashes).
